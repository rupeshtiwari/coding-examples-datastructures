# Data Structure & Algorithm Programming & problem solving

## You have 17 yrs of full stack coding experience still solve School level DS & Algorithm problems!

The most important thing you need in the journey of cracking Big-4 companies is true confidence. When I started I had 17 years of coding experience with Angular Development, Asp.net C#, full stack coding etc. So I had over confident that I can solve directly competitive programming problems. This is not a true confidence. This type of confidence will help you for few days then you will stop since you will not be able to solve many problems.

I am from non-computer background when in some problem people say knap-sack, back tracing, DP, two-pointers etc. I don't used to understand anything out of it. Therefore, I could not solve competitive programming and you can not remember problems if you really want to crack coding interview.

Therefore, I would ask you if you are also like me non-computer science engineer and having 17 years of full stack development background. Still start solving `Data Structure and Algorithm` problems from `SCHOOL` level first. Yes I am not kidding. Like I said you need true confidence. And I will assure you if you start solving some problems that you can solve and you will get confidence slowly to solve higher difficulty levels like `BASIC`, `MEDIUM` etc.

Therefore, here is the plan I am going to follow. I will assume, I don't know any coding and I am going to start from the beginning.

## What plan I have to learn coding?

I will try to choose some book that I can understand. I know many people says Algorithm Manual/Design books are great. However, my truth is I could not understand those books✋. I have to find out some book for DS and Algorithm and learn basics. Then I will solve school level problems. Then I will slowing go solving higher level problems. After I finish DS & Algorithms then I will start attempting Competitive Programming problems.

## Which Language should I use in a coding interview?

Many companies don’t prefer Python in coding interviews. Because, it has an in-built library for stack or so on. If you are doing Python then learn one more language in backup ( C#, C, C++ or Java ). Python is mostly used in Data Science and Machine Learning since these topics are very complex and you must write less code to solve these big problems.

I am going to use JavaScript for coding interview. I am not `node.js` expert. Therefore, for server side concepts I will use `C# language`. Since from last 17 years I have been coding in `Asp.net C#`.

## Where should I practice for DS and Algorithm problems?

Use geeksforgeeks.com to practice data structure and algorithm problems.

- Solve Problems for DS & Algorithm
- Reading company interview experiences

Amazon, FB etc. they ask the questions from the Geek for Geeks sometime. So it is a good idea to solve them. Geeks For Geeks is the best site to start learning coding for any beginners.

- Go to [https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/)
- Then do 50 questions per data structures
- Do more than 50 for Array and String

In Geek of Geeks you can filter difficulty level and you can also check which problem is asked in which company. Select Array then filter by Basic, Medium or Hard then work on them.

Every day you do 2 basic, 2 medium and 1 hard problem per data structure

## Which Data Structure Problem Should I Focus and solve?

Do 50 questions on below data structures. Do 70 questions on Array and Linked List. First solve the problems which are described in the [data structure in Hindi videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5JfBFfi2sU&list=PLg6p_zdrEgHEqaRQbZADU6suNgh28JiKb&index=1). Then solve others on your own. If you don't watch videos and try to solve your own in Geek of Geeks you will solve 5 problems. However, if you watch videos and solve them then you should be able to solve 15 problems on your own. Do below Data Structure:

- Array
- Link List
- Stack
- Queue
- Tree
- Graph

### Linear Storage

- Array
- Link List
- Stack
- Queue

### Non Linear Storage

- Tree
- Graph

If you get some problem and want to solve that. You will write some code step by step. That is called algorithm.

## Which Algorithm Problem Should I Do?

Most of the companies ask DP problems, they are very important.

- Sorting - do 50 problems
- Greedy - do 70 problems
- Dynamic Programming - do 70 problems

If you finish Dynamic programming then whatever Data Structure concepts that you have first finished. There you can optimize your solution using Dynamic Programming.

## Bitwise operation in JavaScript

### Right Shift x>>y

Moving bit/s towards the right side in binary number.

`x>>y` means `x/2^y` divide x by 2 to the power of y.

### Left Shift x<<y

Moving bit/s towards the left side in binary number.

`4<<2 == 0`

`x<<y` means `x*2^y` multiply x by 2 to the power of y.

## Time Complexity

Within a `1 second` normally `10^8` loop can run. If your solution is trying to run more than 10^8 loops within a second. You need to optimize your solution to bring it within a range.
